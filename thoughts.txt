reply.author customer vs admin cascade with magento hooks and stuff?


EXPORT COMMITS
for /f "usebackq tokens=*" %A in (`git diff-tree -r --name-only af7d HEAD`) do echo FA|xcopy "%~fA" "C:\git_changed_files\%A"

todo:
Convert migrations in proper magento "cross platform way"
Lots of TODOs in code
Missing customer and website data in admin
MY ACCOUNT.MY TICKETS add "unread items" counter
Need to check what protection magento offers by default. sql attacks should be fine,
what about client side vectors, XSS and friends?


unimplemented features:
1. support can configure email notifications:
    for each customer reply
    only for new ticket
    new + watching
    watching
    ===
    watching is flag that is set on ticket by admin/customer support

2. customers should also get notifications
    configurable in admin, by admin
    if enabled: all
                customers have checkbox which will subscribe them
    if disabled, admin can tick send notification checkbox when replying in admin panel

3. admins can add watchers to ticket, multi stage process where "original" customer has to agree
    when ticket is updated, watchers are notified
